ckmeans
=======

Ckmeans is an implementation of a fast k-means clustering algorithm developed
by
[Haizhou Wang and Mingzhou Song](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-2/RJournal_2011-2_Wang+Song.pdf).

The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the optimal
grouping of any array of numbers into k clusters.

This code follows directly from Tom MacWright's code in
[simple-statistics](https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics/blob/master/src/ckmeans.js)
